            <p>I am a senior at Lehman College with a major in Computer Graphics Interface (CGI). 
                I spend a lot of time pondering inside my mind in the clouds while listening to a selection of music, 
                thinking of characters, artwork and worlds that I plan to create and share. 
                I enjoy drawing and animating.
            </p>

            <p>The programming languages I am familiar with
                is Java and some html. The project I have created is
                a website using Adobe Dreamweaver in ART 221.
